    "MY APPROACH\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 1:\n",
    "Finding the books which user has readed and the books which has same authors and score them (scoring system : book read by user =1 , book which has same author +=0.25).\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 2:\n",
    "Finding the top users which has similar taste in books by aggrating the sum of score from the score of books (in simple words finding the user score by how many book they have read that have more that 0 score and summing it) \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "suppose user A has read 80 books in total from which 36 books has 0 score, 40 books has 0.25 score and 4 books has 1.25 score so user A total_score is 40 * 0.25 + 4 * 1.25 which is equal to 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 3:\n",
    "finding the books which is read by most users based on their score (in simple words books are scored by how many users has read them * by their score respictively)\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "suppose book K is read by 38 users from which 8 have score of 0 ,10 has score of 6 and 20 has score of 5 then book_score is 160"
